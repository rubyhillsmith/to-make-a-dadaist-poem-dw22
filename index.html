    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `The statistics for the record-breaking ship are staggering. It’s 362m long, it can carry 6988 passengers along with 2300 crew and can hold enough beer to fill all the swimming pools on board twice over. “It’s hard to believe you are even on a ship. It’s a city on the water. There is everything you could ever want. There’s no reason to ever get off,” one passenger said. “We’re going to need a bigger ocean,” another joked. The colossal ship has 18 decks, 16 for passengers. It has a top speed of 22 knots thanks to three 20,000 kilowatt diesel-electric thrusters under the stern and four bow thrusters, each generating 7500 horsepower. A source told the Mail on Sunday the ship had undergone a refurbishment. “Restaurants have been renamed and signs in Mandarin have been changed to English. She will sail around the Caribbean before switching to European cruises this summer,” they said. Onboard is also a boardwalk, designed on the Coney Island attraction and is lined with restaurants serving up Italian, French and German cuisine, along with US staples such as hotdogs and pizzas. There is also a Las Vegas-style casino on board. On another deck there’s Central Park, complete with 20,000 plants and trees. Passengers can sip cocktails made by robots in the Bionic Bar which is situated on the Royal Promenade.
